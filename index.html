                    <ul>
                            <li>Created a cryptocurrency exchange vetting process engine, which interacts with many platforms and on the basis of transactions happening at different ends calculate accurate information related to crypto currency such as price, 24 hour trading volume, market cap and many more. Tech Stack:- Python, AWS(RDS, ec2, lambda, S3 and many more), mysql, msssql, github action, JIRA, kubernetes, dockers
                               <ul>
                                <li>Lead developer of a small team working on pricing and vetting crypto currency coins.</li>
                                <li>Designed a smart engine which compares data from different exchanges and removes the outliers. It also categories data into different zones so that data which is showing fluctuation can be highlighted on UI.</li>
                                <li>Designed jira approved one click end to end deployment CI/CD pipeline using github actions.</li>
                                <li>Developed multiple complex data extraction/scraping approaches like dynamic scrapping, api extraction. Also created multiple data access points  like Swagger api, sftp and FIX format</li>
                                <li>Supported the deployment of a robust engine which continuously collects trades with minimal gaps using RDS, S3, EKS and dockers.</li>
                                </ul> 
                            </li>
                            <li>Template matching e-KYC:- we have developed a heuristic based classification angle matching approach. It will find cosine similarity between different text field angles and map them with our already recorded data, on the basis of which we can identify document type and can extract information from the input image. Tech Stack:-  Python, Tesseract, GCP, mysql, Github, jira.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lead a team of 4 developers and created a heuristic algorithm to scan text from the documents like passport , driving license.</li>
                                <li>Trained tesseract model on the document templates and recorded its observation for our model in mysql.</li>
                                <li>Created a preprocessing image pipeline which will remove shadows, convert it to grayscale and rotate the image to horizontal position.</li>
                                <li>Designed a template matching pipeline which will calculate the image text field cosine similarity and compare with our existing data for document identification purposes.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
